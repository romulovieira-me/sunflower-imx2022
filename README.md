# Sunflower: an Interactive Artistic Environment based on IoMusT Concepts

The Internet of Musical Things (IoMusT) is an interdisciplinary area that aims to improve the relationship between musicians and their peers, as well as between musicians and audience members, creating new forms of interaction in concerts, studio productions, and music learning. 

Although emerging, this field already faces some challenges, such as lack of privacy and security, and mainly, lack of standardization and interoperability between its devices. Therefore, an environment design, called Sunflower, was proposed, which tries to contribute to solving the most recurrent problems in this area, specifying an architecture pattern, protocol, and sound features that aim to allow heterogeneity in these systems. 

Its practical implementation resulted in an interoperable, multimedia, and interactive environment. This paper, therefore, shows a demonstration of how Sunflower works in the accomplishment of an artistic presentation, also emphasizing its approach, the technologies that support it, and the advances it can bring to the area of IoMusT.
